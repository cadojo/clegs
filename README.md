Learn C a lÃ  rustlings!

## Usage

It would be so cool to have an automated script (like `rustlings`) that guides each student 
through the exercises, and offers help along the way. Unfortunately, **that script does not 
exist yet!** Honestly, it may never exist. That's okay --- VSCode offers a pretty 
user-friendly debugging experience. I recommend using Visual Studio Code with the C/C++ 
Extension Pack, and "running" the programs under [`/exercises`](/exercises/) that you're 
most interested in. All program files are grouped by core concept, and each file's name 
describes the specific content it explores.

Want to work through all of them? I recommend working through the exercises in the following order.
